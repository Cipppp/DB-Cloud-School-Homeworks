# Homework:
* create a fresh repository  Done
* create a Spring Boot project and design an API for a Market (users have a cart, and add and remove products, each user has an id, and also a Wishlist;
* create all CRUD operations for Users, Cart, and Wishlist, use H2 (in-memory) as a database)
* create unit tests for it
* comments would be a nice addition

### Please make sure to have the extra endpoints:
* an endpoint where I can get all the carts from all the users, sorted by the total of the products (a product must have a name, price, and a quantity)

* an endpoint where I can get all the users sorted by their number of orders (users will also have order history, make sure to implement it
